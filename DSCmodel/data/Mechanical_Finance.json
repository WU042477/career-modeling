We embrace the culture of digital nomads and provide a fully remote work environment where employees can use their professional skills anywhere in the world. Job Title; Remote Financial Data Strategy Analyst  Job Description; When you are alone in Alaska, cod are jumping out of the sea. When you are analyzing the market in Meili Snow Mountain, golden monkeys are just climbing to the top of the tree. When you share insights with your partners in Tibet, mountain eagles are hovering in the clouds above your head. When you are waiting for market opportunities in Nepal, backpackers are sitting by the campfire with glasses of wine. Yes, if you want to describe the work and life of digital nomads, the above text is the most appropriate. In the new millennium, digital nomads are no longer national assets, but customers of the government. ——Excerpt from \"The Sovereign Individual\" Now, the job that you are touching, which starts as a trader but has no end and no ceiling, happens to be able to achieve this lifestyle . These words are true, even if you save them and look back on them ten years later. Whether you are a brave man who has just become interested in trading, or an experienced person who has already tried the water in this ocean. Do you know that secondary market trading is a fantasy swamp, where thousands of skeletons are piled up, and there is only one way out of this swamp. And those who come here to self-study, research, discuss, communicate, try their luck, and gamble are all dead ends. Some people, out of curiosity, step into the swamp. Whether it is a small profit or a small loss, they feel that this is not an ordinary place and something is wrong, so they turn around and leave and never set foot here again. Some people have heard that their friends had good luck here and gained a lot of wealth, so they also want to try their luck. After reading some analysis and reports, they hastily followed the crowd and made some \"asset allocation\". As soon as they came in, they were \"trapped\" and lost confidence in the market. They were unwilling to face losses and became passive \"long-term value investors\". Some people have heard of the miracles created by legendary figures in history here, and want to devote their lives to studying here, or collect various books and materials to study, or discuss and communicate with three or five \"like-minded\" people all night . The vast majority of these people; at best they wasted a lot of time and money, and at worst their wives and children were separated and their families were broken up. Everyone, don't forget this common sense; Swamps can drown people . There is only one way to safely pass through a swamp; under the guidance and leadership of the guide, hold hands with other companions and support each other, but don't talk or communicate along the way, just follow the guide's instructions, endure the temptation of the illusion around the swamp, follow the guide's footsteps, and move forward carefully in the swamp. Only in this way can you ensure that you don't get lost in this illusionary swamp, and then you can move towards your goal. No matter what your goal is; to master a skill that can make a living here to support your family; to get a free job ; to become a top trader in the industry; to set up your own \"medal\" fund like a Wall Street fund manager; or even to participate in future financial wars. All can be achieved here, because this swamp is large enough, with both a huge space for fish to jump and let you pick up a knife to fly, and a micro-ecology of coral islands for you to live freely. For those who are curious, have decided to step into the secondary market, or have already stepped into the secondary market, you know that it is no longer the era when gravity can be figured out by smashing an apple on the head. To produce a major scientific result, it takes a lot of manpower, material resources, computing power and cooperation. The era of fighting alone is over. Only by working together can new miracles appear. If you are still full of curiosity and ideals and want to explore this swamp, we provide a safe and efficient way; What will you experience here? At the beginning; You will be screened, tested, trained and grown into the most basic quantitative system evaluation executor as a junior brave. During this period, you will; Learn the rules and principles of the use of quantitative systems. Under the guidance of the wizard, evaluate the matching mechanism between the quantitative system and itself, strictly implement strategies, statistical parameters and write reports. Finally, through the data screening mechanism we set up, become a qualified quantitative system executor. If we find that you are not suitable for this job during the longest one-month assessment period, we will persuade you to quit . If you pass our screening and assessment, you will have the core conditions of a digital nomad [skills not constrained by geographical environment]. You can create a steady stream of income for yourself through the Internet to support your lifestyle anywhere in the world. After that, you can choose to continue to participate in the testing, development, and optimization of quantitative systems, and continue to improve model strategies to become a senior master in the industry... - Or transform into a guide for others, answer questions for newcomers who come later, guide the way forward through the swamp, and become a leader of young people... Okay, the topic has gone too far. Let's go back to the beginning. In order to make you more likely to be selected by us and pass the assessment to meet the relevant skill level requirements, we have the following expectations for newcomers; If you are an overseas Chinese or an international student, welcome! If you have a bachelor's degree in a domestic 985\/211 university, welcome! If you have life experience in a new first-tier or first-tier city, or have experienced different lifestyles , welcome! If you have been in the army and deeply understand the importance of obeying orders and listening to commands, welcome! If you are young, 22-32 years old, and your thinking is not rigid, welcome! Hard conditions; stable personal conditions, independent working environment, and personal computer or laptop to support the early training and efficient work and study. In the end, there are very few people who are suitable for trading. If you are not ready and just want to try it out, please do not submit your resume. We welcome those brave people who have a strong desire, are ready, determined, and abide by the discipline to come to the swamp to explore it.",

If you have an idea, you can have a good chat. The company has good benefits, treatment, office environment, and colleagues are easy to get along with. Work from 9 am to 6 pm, holidays are off, no overtime, and working hours are flexible. Next is the salary issue that you are most concerned about. Commission is 50%. The better the performance, the higher the salary. The commission is very good. You can get half. You must make money in sales. And as long as you have no problem communicating with people in Mandarin and people can understand what you say, it doesn’t matter as long as your education level and age are not illegal. The threshold is so low. You are also concerned about the content of the work; it is marketing, you can get customers through online media, communicate with other loan company bosses to reach a cooperation and take over the case, or sell cars to the company by telephone. As long as there are customers, you can do it. The company’s channels are pretty good. The trend of the entire industry is pretty good.
